A backend is an abstract concept. Any piece of code that can run on a machine
is a backend. If that code is being used by another piece of code, it is the
backend of that other code. In turn, if the code uses another piece of code, it
becomes a frontend to that piece of code.

In simpler terms, anything being used by another entity without knowing the
inner workings of that thing is a backend. The role of a backend developer is
to expose a way to solve a business problem.

A kitchen of a restaurant can be a metaphor for a backend. The cooks cook food
which we as a customer don't have any idea about. We just order via a waiter
and he takes care of placing our order to the chefs and getting us our desired
dish. In this sense, the kitchen is the backend of the restaurant where the
food is being cooked and served from. The waiter that is mediating between the
chefs and customers is analogous to an API through which we communicate with
the backend. Finally, the dish that is being served to us is the resource of
that restaurant that the backend is providing.

## What's an User Interface?

The way a user accesses/uses a particular entity is that entity's user
interface. It's something we can see, touch or feel but, won't know what it's
doing to get the results it is producing. The backend should not be visible to
the end-user and only should be accessed via an interface. ## Perspectives of
Backend Development

- Programmer
  - Write business logic and allow other entities to use its features.
  - Use frameworks to do commonly required functionality.
- Architect
  - Manage infrastructure and resources.

## Goals of a Backend Developer

- Expertise in a particular set of technologies.
  - Programming Language (Rust)
  - Database (PostgreSQL)
- System design and architecting.
  - Make decisions based on time and resource constraints.
- Design and develop APIs.
  - Understand good API design principles.
- Learn DevOps and CI/CD.
  - Understand deployment architecture and development pipelines.
- Model and engineer data.
- Take security measures to protect services.

## Requirements for Backend Development

- Virtualization
- Operating System
- Networking
