We have it! We have a working game engine! Well.. technically it's just the core functionality of a game engine but, it's something nonetheless. Over the past few days I've set up the project repository and socials but, there was no actual code to show for. That changed on the latest pull request.

![Game Engine Creation Pull Request](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1092561957195874406/1114550039168176279/image.png)

This game engine is responsible for maintaining the core game logic of the game. I plan on making this engine available through a standalone library. This will allow us to use this engine in both the frontend and the backend to maintain game state and logic.

Here's how the code is signature looks like right now.

```typescript
class Game<Player, Word> {
  startLobby(): LobbyingGame<Player, Word> {}
}

class LobbyingGame<Player, Word> {
  state: GameState;
  players: Set<Player>;

  constructor() {}

  addPlayer(player: Player) {}

  startGame(): RunningGame<Player, Word> {}
}

class RunningGame<Player, Word> {
  state: GameState;
  players: Set<Player>;
  words: Set<Word>;
  currentPlayer: Player;
  playerAliveStates: Map<Player, boolean>;

  constructor(players: Set<Player>) {}

  addWord(word: Word) {}

  selectNextPlayer() {}

  killCurrentPlayer() {}

  hasGameEnded(): boolean {}

  getFinishedGame(): FinishedGame<Player, Word> {}
}

class FinishedGame<Player, Word> {
  state: GameState;
  players: Set<Player>;
  words: Set<Word>;
  playerAliveStates: Map<Player, boolean>;
  winner: Player;

  constructor(
    players: Set<Player>,
    words: Set<Word>,
    playerAliveStates: Map<Player, boolean>
  ) {}
}
```

The code still lacks documentation as of now but that should be taken care of by this [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jNaimXIII/Shiritori/issues/14). Although, the names of the methods and properties are pretty self explanatory so, even without the documentation and some code browsing, anyone should be able to understand what's going on. After all, this game is stupid simple.

Let's see how a general game of Shiritori should be played using this engine.

```typescript
const game = new Game<string, string>();

const lobbyingGame = game.startLobby();

lobbyingGame.addPlayer("Jannatin Naim");
lobbyingGame.addPlayer("Sidratul Shams");
lobbyingGame.addPlayer("Tanvir Rayhan");
lobbyingGame.addPlayer("Rifat Mahbub");

const runningGame = lobbyingGame.startGame();

runningGame.addWord("soup");

runningGame.addWord("plus");

runningGame.addWord("something");

runningGame.addWord("great");

runningGame.killCurrentPlayer();
console.log(runningGame.hasGameEnded()); // -> false

runningGame.killCurrentPlayer();
console.log(runningGame.hasGameEnded()); // -> false

runningGame.killCurrentPlayer();
console.log(runningGame.hasGameEnded()); // -> true

const finishedGame = runningGame.getFinishedGame();

console.log(finishedGame); // -> FinishedGame { ... }
```

So, now that we have a working game engine, the next step is to add a database to the project. I'll also have to find a proper way to store this game state. Since there's a lot of relational data and these relations are interconnected, i'll have to research a bit on a proper way to store this.

But, that's for some other day. Keep an eye on the project over at [GitHub](https://github.com/jNaimXIII/Shiritori). See ya.
