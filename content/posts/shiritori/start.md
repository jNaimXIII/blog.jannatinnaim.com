So, what's all this about? Shiritori (しりとり) is a Japanese word game in which the players are required to say a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word. What I'm trying to do here is to make the same game playable online with friends. I've been meaning to build this for a long time but never got around to it. Finally, I took the initiative to start the project and this is the first log of the project.

## The plan

As I am right now, I don't know much about backend development. I plan to build this project from the absolute basics and the slowly add features to it. The technologies used in this project will change based on my learning and the requirements of the project.

So, instead of jumping directly into code, I've taken my time to setup the core foundations for the project. Those include:

- [x] Setup [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/jNaimXIII/Shiritori)
- [x] Setup [a GitHub project board](https://github.com/users/jNaimXIII/projects/2)
- [x] Setup [a GitHub wiki](https://github.com/jNaimXIII/Shiritori/wiki)
- [x] Setup [a Discord server](https://discord.gg/cEfeD9fYcF)
- [x] Setup [a Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14E9U1UzmIfq1-F18QrrEHG0bhAh1-aNS?usp=sharing)
- [x] Setup [a Google Calendar calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=NmYwMWIzM2I2YzUzYmRkYzc5YWY4NTE4OWFhNGFiYWQ2N2JkYTQwNmQ5NTVhMmZiYTc4YmM0ODkwMGJkOGE5MUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)

With all these, I'm ready to now work on the actual project. I'll be posting updates on the project on this blog and on [my socials](https://jannatinnaim.com/). So, stay tuned for more updates.
