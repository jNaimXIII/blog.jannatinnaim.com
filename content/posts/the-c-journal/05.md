Finally at the end of chapter one of _The C Programming Language_ book after
finishing the "1.9 Character Arrays" and "1.10 External Variables and Scope"
sections.

These sections were more about building things with the C language and less
about constructs of the language.

## Character Arrays / Strings

Strings are character arrays that terminate with a `\0` at the end. The
`printf` function can use this type of `char` arrays with the format specifier
`%s` to print the entire string.

## External and Automatic Variables

- `definition`: refers to the place where the variable is called or assigned
  storage.
- `declaration`: refers to places where the nature of the variable is stated
  but no storage is allocated.

Automatic variables are those that come into existence when a function is
called and disappear when the function exits. These are the variables we define
inside the functions such as loop iteration counters.

It is possible to define variables that are external to all functions, that is
, variables that can be accessed by name by any function. External variables
are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to
communicate data between functions.

External variables remain in existence permanently, rather than appearing and
disappearing as functions are called and exited, they retain their values even
after the functions that set them have returned.

An external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside any function; this
sets aside storage for it. The variable must also be declared in each function
that wants to access it; this states the type of the variable.

Before a function can use an external variable, the name of the variable must
be made known to the function. One way to do this is to write an `extern`
declaration in the function; the declaration is the same as before except for
the added keyword `extern`.

The declaration may be an explicit `extern` statement or may be implicit from
context. In certain circumstances, the `extern` declaration can be omitted. If
the definition of an external variable occurs in the source file before its use
in a particular function, then there is no need for an external declaration in
the function.

Common practice is to place definitions of all external variables at the
beginning of the source file, and then omit all `extern` declarations. The
usual practice is to collect `extern` declarations of variables and functions
in a separate file, historically called a `header`, that is included by
`#include` at the front of each source file. The suffix `.h` is conventional
for header names. The functions of the standard library, for example, are
declared in headers like `<stdio.h>`.

Relying too heavily on external variables is fraught with peril since it leads
to programs whose data connections are not at all obvious -- variables can be
changed in unexpected and even inadvertent ways, and the program is hard to
modify.

## Programs Built

Throughout these two sections and their exercise, we get to build several
programs that perform vastly different tasks.

### Longest Input Line

One such program is one that prints the longest line from its given input.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXLINE 1000 /* maximum input line size */

int get_line(char line[], int maxline);
void copy(char to[], char from[]);

/* print longest input line */
main()
{
    int len;                  /* current line length */
    int max;                  /* maximum length seen so far */
    char line[MAXLINE];       /* current input line */
    char longest[MAXLINE];    /* longest line saved here */

    max = 0;
    while ((len = get_line(line, MAXLINE)) > 0)
    {
        printf("%d %s", len, line);

        if (len > max) {
            max = len;
            copy(longest, line);
        }
    }
    if (max > 0) /* there was a line */
        printf("longest: %d %s", max, longest);

    return 0;
}

/* get_line:  read a line into s, return length */
int get_line(char s[], int lim)
{
    int c, i;

    for (i = 0; i < lim - 1 && (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n'; ++i)
        s[i] = c;
    if (c == '\n') {
        s[i] = c;
        ++i;
    }
    s[i] = '\0';
    return i;
}

/* copy:  copy 'from' into 'to'; assume to is big enough */
void copy(char to[], char from[])
{
    int i;

    i = 0;
    while ((to[i] = from[i]) != '\0')
        ++i;
}
```

### Remove Trailing Whitespace

This program removes trailing whitespaces from its input.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXLINE 1000 /* maximum input line size */

int get_line(char line[], int maxline);
void copy(char to[], char from[]);

/* print input line without whitespace */
main()
{
    int len;                  /* current line length */
    char line[MAXLINE];       /* current input line */

    while ((len = get_line(line, MAXLINE)) > 0)
    {
        while(line[len - 1] == '\n' || line[len - 1] == ' ' || line[len - 1] == '\t')
        {
            line[len - 1] = '\0';
            --len;
        }

        printf("%d %s\n", len, line);
    }

    return 0;
}

/* get_line:  read a line into s, return length */
int get_line(char s[], int lim)
{
    int c, i;

    for (i = 0; i < lim - 1 && (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n'; ++i)
        s[i] = c;
    if (c == '\n') {
        s[i] = c;
        ++i;
    }
    s[i] = '\0';
    return i;
}
```

### DeTab

This program is responsible for converting tabs into spaces from its input.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define TABSTOP 2

/* convert spaces into tabs */
main()
{
    int c, i, spaces;

    spaces = 0;
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
        if (c != ' ') {
            if (spaces > 0) {
                for (i = 1; i <= spaces; ++i)
                    putchar(' ');
            }

            putchar(c);
        }
        else {
            ++spaces;

            if (spaces >= TABSTOP) {
                putchar('\t');
                spaces -= TABSTOP;
            }
        }
}
```

### Remove Comments

This program removes comments from C program files. It only works for comments
that use the `/* comment */` notation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define IN 1
#define OUT 0

/* remove comments from c programs */
main()
{
    int c;
    int previous, state;

    previous = '\0';
    state = OUT;

    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (c == '*') {
            if (previous == '/')
                state = IN;
        } else if (c == '/') {
            if (previous == '*')
                state = OUT;
        } else if (state == OUT) {
            putchar(c);
        }

        previous = c;
    }
}
```

## Learning Experience

After building all these programs I now understand the basics of program
building in C. Although there were some exercises that I weren't able to
complete and skipped this far, I'll get back to them later.

I'm really excited to get into the next chapters of the book and see what lies
ahead for me. :)
